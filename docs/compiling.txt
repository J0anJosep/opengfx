COMPILING
=========
In order to compile OpenGFX from source, you need to get yourself a copy of GRFCodec:
http://www.ttdpatch.net/grfcodec/

Place the GRFCodec executable/binary outside the opengfx main folder, like so:

|- root folder
|  |- opengfx
|  |  |- docs
|  |  |  |-...
|  |  |- sprites
|  |  |  |-...
|  |  |- ...
|  |  |- opengfx.obg
|  |- grfcodec(.exe)


CD to "root folder" and run the following six commands from commandline:
  grfcodec.exe -e -p 2 ogfx1.grf ogfx/sprites/
  grfcodec.exe -e -p 2 ogfxc.grf ogfx/sprites/
  grfcodec.exe -e -p 2 ogfxh.grf ogfx/sprites/
  grfcodec.exe -e -p 2 ogfxi.grf ogfx/sprites/
  grfcodec.exe -e -p 2 ogfxt.grf ogfx/sprites/
  grfcodec.exe -e -p 2 ogfxe.grf ogfx/sprites/

On non-Windows OS you obviously have to leave out the .exe in grfcodec.exe.

These commands can easily be run from a makefile. An example batch file for the Windows operating
system is provided. The spirit of this file can be used in makefiles for other operating systems
as well. Feel free to invent a more sophisticated makefile that also updates the .obg file automatically.

After completing the commands, six new .grf files are created in said "root folder".
Of each of these files, the MD5 checksum needs to be calculated.

Now open the opengfx.obg file using your favourite plaintext editor. Replace the existing MD5 hashes
from the [md5s] section with the newly calculated values.

"OpenGFX" now exists and is the following 9 files:
  - ogfx1.grf
  - ogfxc.grf
  - ogfxh.grf
  - ogfxi.grf
  - ogfxt.grf
  - ogfxe.grf
  - ogfx.obg
  - readme.txt
  - license.txt

At your option, these 9 files can be tarred into a single tarball for easy use with OpenTTD.
